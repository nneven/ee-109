			 Lab 4 - Using the LCD Display

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) We want you to feel comfortable reading documentation to
understand the operation of a device.  To that end, open the ATmega328/P
datasheet linked on our website from the Tools and Links Page.  Go to section
18.2 and read over pages 98-99. What effect does writing a 1 to a PIN register
bit have?


"Writing a '1' to PINxn toggles the value of PORTxn, independent on the value of DDRxn. The SBI instruction can be used to toggle one single bit in a port."


Consider how this might be used to generate the E signal pulse in your
lcd_writenibble() function.  In your text file for this answer,
re-write the 3 or so lines of code you had to generate the E signal pulse for
about 250ns using the feature of writing a 1 to a PIN register bit.
Make sure you use the correct register, masking, etc.


PINB |= (1 << 1);
PORTB |= (1 << PB1);
PORTB &= ~(1 << PB1);


2. (1 point) Suppose we need to perform 3 concurrent tasks intermittently: Task
A every 20 ms, Task B every 15 ms, and Task C every 40 ms. What delay should be
used on each iteration of the main loop?
 
There should be a 5ms delay used for each iteration of the main loop
