Edit the document below to fill your answers from the exercises done in lab.
Be sure to include the proper units, such as "1 kOhm", or "200 mV"

1. What voltage was the power supply set for, and what voltage did the
   DMM measure?
        Power supply =  2.58 volts
        DMM =  2.579 volts


2. What are the values of the resistors?  List the values from smallest to
   largest.
   From the color bands:
		R1 =  260 ohms
		R2 =  560 ohms
		R3 =  1000 ohms
         
   The measured values:
        R1 =  264 ohms
        R2 =  553 ohms
        R3 =  988 ohms


3. In the circuit with Vs=5V and resistors R1 and R2 in series what are the
   calculated voltages across them?
        V1 =  1.59 volts
        V2 =  3.41 volts


4. In the circuit with Vs=5V and resistors R1 and R2 in series what are the
   measured voltages across them?
        V1 =  1.61 volts
        V2 =  3.38 volts


5. What are the voltages (or range of voltages) on the switch output when it
   is not pressed and when it is pressed?
        Not pressed =  -1 to 1 volts
        Pressed =  0 volts


6. With resistor R2 added to the circuit, what are the voltages on the switch
   output when it is not pressed and when it is pressed?
        Not pressed =  4.99 volts
        Pressed =  0.4 volts


7. Assuming Vs = 4.0V and a Vled of 2.0V, calculate the current flowing through
   the LED for both resistors.  Use the values that you measured for R1 and R3.
                Resistance     Current
        R1:      264 ohms	  0.0076 amps
        R3:      988 ohms	  0.002 amps


8. Fill in the table below with the input voltages to the 74LS04 inverter
   and the resulting output voltage,

   Input voltage        Output voltage
        0.0                 4.426
        0.2                 4.426
        0.4                 4.426
        0.6                 4.420
        0.8                 4.327
        1.0                 2.879
        1.2                 0.14
        1.4                 0.14
        1.6                 0.14
        1.8                 0.14
        2.0                 0.14
        3.0                 0.14
        4.0                 0.14
        5.0                 0.14
