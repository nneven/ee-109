Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (3 points) Review the conceptual operation of an ADC and use the given
parameters to find the desired value.

  a. Your 8-bit ADC has Hi and Lo reference voltages of 1V and 4V, what digital
  number would result from sampling a 2.0V?

  (2^8 * 2) / 4V = 128

  b. Your 5-bit ADC has Hi and Lo reference voltages of 0V and 5V, what input
  voltage would yield a digital number of 12?

  (2^5 * x) / 5V = 12, x = 1.875V

  c.  Your 6-bit ADC has a Lo reference voltages of 2V. A voltage is sampled at
  2.4V and the digital result is 26. What was the Hi reference voltage used by
  the ADC?

  (2^6 * 2.4) / x = 26, x = 5.9V


2. (1 points We want you to feel comfortable reading documentation to
understand the operation of a device. To that end, open the ATmega328/P
datasheet linked on our website from the Tools and Links Page and go to chapter
28 regarding the ADC. Read over the register bit descriptions of ADCSRA and
ADCSRB in sections 28.9.2 and 28.9.7, respectively. In addition, skim through
section 28.4 and view the timing diagrams.

Now consider what effect setting the ADATE bit of ADCSRA to a 1 will have,
assuming you don't modify ADCSRB from its default reset value. Briefly describe
what the ADC module will do.


From datasheet - "When this bit is written to one, Auto Triggering the ADC is enabled. The ADC will start a conversion on a positive edge of the selected trigger signal. The trigger source is selcted by setting the ADC Trigger Select bits."
