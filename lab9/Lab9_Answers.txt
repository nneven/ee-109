end of the assignment web page.


1. (1 points) Briefly explain why a common GND signal is needed between
transmitter and receiver devices.

Voltage levels with respect to ground represent the RS 232 signals. There is a wire 
for each signal, together with the ground signal (reference for voltage levels). Due 
to the way the signals are connected, a common ground is required.

2. (2 points) The baud rate (e.g. 9600 bps) is the rate at which 1's and 0's
are transmitted over the serial line.  Briefly explain why the data rate (rate
at which useful data is transmitted/received) is less than the baud rate even
with error-free transmission.

It is impossible for the data rate to be higher than the baud rate because the baud 
rate is the maximum flow of 1's and 0's that are transmitted over the serial line. The 
data rate is lower to ensure that every bit of useful data can be represented and 
transferred properly given the baud rate
