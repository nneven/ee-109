Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) Review the conceptual operation of a timer interrupt.

  a. For a 16-bit timer with clock frequency of 16MHz (like the Arduino) and
  prescalar of 64, how much time corresponds to a timer value of 2000?

  16,000,000 / 64 = 250,000
  2000 / 250,000 = 0.008 seconds

  b. With a clock frequency of 16MHz and prescalar of 8, what is the longest
  amount of time we can track with an 8-bit hardware timer.

  The largest value you can hold in an 8-bit number is 255.
  16,000,000 / 8 = 2,000,000
  2,000,000 / 255 = .0001275 seconds

2. (2 points) We want you to feel comfortable reading documentation to
understand the operation of a device. To that end, open the ATmega328/P
datasheet linked on our website from the Tools and Links Page. The Timer we
have used also has the ability to make an output pin turn ON (set), OFF
(clear), or Toggle when the timer reaches the OCR1A value (i.e. in addition to
generating an interrupt, the hardware can automatically toggle or turn an
output on or off). By searching the data sheet and using the information in
section 20.14.1 (especially table 20-3) answer the following questions:

  a. Which two pins can TIMER 1 (the 16-bit) timer control (i.e. what pins are
  associated with OC1A and OC1B)?

  The COM1A[1:0] and COM1B[1:0] control the Output Compare pins
  (OC1A and OC1B respectively) behavior.

  b. Describe what those pins would do when the timer reached the OCR1A value
  if during initialization we used the statement TCCR1A |= 0x60; (Note: The PDF
  register description of TCCR1A is a bit unclear: bit 7:6 corresponds to
  COM1A1,COM1A0 and bit 5:4 corresponds to COM1B1,COM1B0).

  If one or both of the COM1A[1:0] bits are written to one, the OC1A output
  overrides the normal port functionality of the I/O pin it is connected to.
  If one or both of the COM1B[1:0] are written to one, the OC1B output overrides
  the normal port functionality of the I/O pin it is connected to. The DDR bit
  corresponding to the OC1A or OC1B pin must be set in order to enable to output driver.
  When the OC1A or OC1B is connected to the pin, the function of the COM1x[1:0]
  bits is dependent of the WGM1[3:0] bits setting.
