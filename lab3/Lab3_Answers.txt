Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) Suppose we relocated the three buttons from group B, bits 5-3 to
group D, bits 5-3, noting that the LED is still attached to group D, bit 2. 
Assuming appropriate DDRD values, consider the following method of turning
on the LED.

    PORTD = 0x04; // turn on the LED

Explain the problem with this approach and, in particular, what would stop
working after the execution of that line of code.

This assignment line of code would execute and change ALL the in bits in group D to 1.
This would cause the buttons to stop functioning, and our LED would constantly be on.

2. (2 points) Briefly explain why the delay between the press of the 'C' button
and the start of the LED on/off sequence varied when you took multiple
measurements?  Think about the timing of how software executes.


When the program runs, it gets caught in the while() loop to detect any change in input from the buttons. The variation is due to the fact that the program is executing different lines of code inside the while loop each time we press our 'C' button.
